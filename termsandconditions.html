        <h2>1.Service Description</h2>

        <p>
            NTT is the owner and operator of <a href="https://www.nomadtravel.al"
                target="_blank">www.nomadtravel.al</a>.
            NTT is a registered Albanian Tour Operator travel company, based on Law 7850, date 29.07.1994
            “The Civil Code of the Republic of Albania” amended, Law 9734, date 14.05.2017
            “On Tourism” amended and other effective legislation, which offers a vast range of tourism and
            related services.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Terms and Conditions</h2>

        <p>
            Your Contract with ‘’TNomad Travel And Tours’’ Ltd VAT number:
            L52304047S & Tour Operator License number LN-2816-03-2017 Its registered address is at STR  Njazi Demi, 13, Tirana, Albania.
        <h6>a) Bookings & Payments</h6>
        Bookings will be considered valid only if confirmation is followed immediately by an advance payment of 20% of
        the total cost.

        <h6>b) Contract</h6>
        To secure a booking NTT requires a non-refundable deposit as above per person per component. Full payment is
        required if 20 days before travel is due to commence (or at an earlier stage for some components). This payment
        is deemed to be confirmation that the client has read and accepts the NTT booking conditions and the risks
        involved in the travel). Clients booking through a travel agent or by telephone email or online will be deemed
        to have read the booking conditions and accepted them. A booking is accepted and becomes definite only from the
        date when NTT has issued a confirmation invoice to the client who makes the booking or their authorized travel
        agent. It is at this point that a contract between TAB and the client comes into existence. TAB reserves the
        right to decline any booking at our discretion.</br>

        The contract is between NTT and the client, being all persons named on the booking as traveling or intending to
        travel with NTT. The person making the booking (which is subject to these terms) warrants that he/she has full
        authority to do so on behalf of all persons named, and confirms that all such persons are fully aware of and
        accept these conditions.</br>

        The contract, including all matters arising from it, is subject to Albanian law and the exclusive jurisdiction
        of its respective courts. No team member of NTT other than a director has the authority to vary or omit any of
        these terms or promise any discount or refund.

        <h2>2. Payment of Components</h2>

        The balance of all monies due, including any surcharges applicable at that time, must be received by NTT not
        later than 20 days before departure. For certain components, full payment must be received at an earlier stage
        before the component starts. You can pay to NTT by bank transfer, and credit card (Visa and Mastercard).
        However, a 4% fee is payable if payment to NTT is made by credit card.</br>

        In the case of non-payment of the balance by the due date, NTT will treat the booking as canceled by the client
        and apply the appropriate cancellation charges.</br>

        Local funds plus any local surcharges must be paid on Day 1 at the destination of travel or as instructed in the
        documentation or by local staff. Failure to pay will result in the client being excluded from the component
        without a refund. Local surcharges are non-refundable for any unused elements of the component. Refer to clause
        6 for further details.</br>

        Monies paid to a travel agent are held on behalf of NTT who is bound by these booking conditions in full.

        <h2>3. Changes</h2>

        <h6>3a. Changes by You</h6>

        A change of departure date and/or component to another must be requested in writing by the person who made the
        original booking. It must also be accompanied by the administration charge per person per component (plus
        additional deposits if applicable) unless the request is within 60 days of departure in which case cancellation
        charges will be applied as detailed in clause 4. The original component deposit and cancellation charges will
        apply based on the departure date of your original component (if changing to a later date) regardless of the
        length of the new component.

        Any changes to extra services must be confirmed in writing by the person who made the original booking and must
        be accompanied by the administration charge per booking in addition to the cost of any extra services required.
        Whilst every reasonable effort will be made to accommodate changes and additional requests their availability
        cannot be guaranteed. Changes to extra services already booked will incur the administration charge. Extra
        services may be added up to one calendar month before departure without charge, however.

        <h6>3b. Changes by us</h6>

        While NTT will do its best to operate all components as advertised, by accepting this contract the client
        accepts that it may prove necessary or advisable to vary or modify a component itinerary or its contents due to
        prevailing local conditions. NTT reserves the right at any time either before or during a component to cancel or
        change any of the facilities, services, or prices described (including transport, accommodation, or other
        arrangements) and to substitute alternative arrangements of comparable value without compensation and accepts no
        liability for loss of enjoyment as a result of these changes.</br>

        If a major change becomes necessary NTT will inform the client as soon as reasonably possible if there is time
        before departure. The definition of a major change will depend on the individual component and circumstances and
        is at the sole discretion of TAB. When a major change is made the client will have the choice of accepting the
        change of arrangements, or within 7 days notification of the change, purchasing another available component or
        canceling the component and obtaining a full refund, provided that the major change is not because of force
        majeure.</br>

        Force majeure is war, the threat of war, riot, civil strife, industrial dispute, terrorist activity, natural or
        nuclear disaster, disease, fire or adverse weather conditions, technical or maintenance problems with local
        transport or NTT vehicles, changes imposed by cancellation or rescheduling of flights by an airline or main
        charterer, the alteration of airline or aircraft type, or other similar events beyond the control of NTT. NTT is
        not liable for any penalty charges associated with non-refundable airfares, in the event of a change to a
        component departure time, date, or airport. All costs incurred due to force majeure such as transportation,
        communication, accommodation, food, or other similar items will be passed to the client by way of local
        surcharges. See clause 6.

        <h2>4. Cancellation</h2>

        <h6>4a. Cancellation by You</h6>

        The client may cancel the booking at any time provided that the cancellation is made to TAB in writing. Written
        notification is essential even if verbal notification of an intention to cancel has been given. Cancellation
        charges will be applied as shown below calculated from the day written notification is received by NTT. The date
        used for calculating cancellation charges will be as follows:

        Group tours, Independent Travel & extra services:</br>

        Till 40 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deposit Only</br>

        Till 30 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30% of Tour Price</br>

        Till 14 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50% of Tour Price</br>

        Less than 14 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100% of Tour Price</br>

        <h6>5a. NOTE: In addition to the above, all cancellations made by the Customers shall be subject to a penalty of
            4.5% of the Tour Price, and any fees applicable to wire transferring of any monies paid.</h6>

        Clients who have booked 2 or more group tours will be subject to the above conditions based on the start dates
        of each group tour booked. Any discounts received due to booking additional group tours will be deducted from
        the refund amount owing for the canceled group tour or invoiced separately if further payment is required.

        <h6>4b. Cancellation by Us</h6>

        TAB reserves the right to cancel a component in any circumstances but will not cancel a component less than 4
        weeks before the component starts, except for force majeure, or the client’s failure to make all payments or one
        of the conditions detailed in Clause 5. Unless the client fails to pay the final balance NTT will, upon
        cancellation, return all monies paid excluding payment for travel insurance and administration charges or offer
        an alternative component of comparable standard.

        <h2>5. Travel Insurance</h2>

        Travel insurance is mandatory for all clients of NTT. Clients together with their personal property including
        baggage are at all times solely at their own risk. Clients are wholly responsible for arranging their insurance.
        A suitable insurance policy should provide adequate cover for medical expenses arising through illness or
        accident before or during the component and loss of component monies through cancellation or curtailment of the
        component for insurable reasons. NTT can assist clients in obtaining a suitable insurance policy. Clients making
        their arrangements should ensure that there are no exclusion clauses limiting protection for the type of
        activities in their component. Clients should satisfy themselves that any travel insurance arranged through TAB
        is what they require and should arrange supplementary insurance if need be. Proof of adequate insurance will be
        requested at the start of your component. Failure to provide this will result in the client being prevented from
        joining the component without a refund.

        <h2>6. Passports, Visas, and Vaccinations</h2>

        It is the responsibility of the client to have a valid passport, visa permits, vaccinations, and preventative
        medicines as may be required for the duration of the component.

        <h2>7. Participation and client responsibility</h2>

        All clients are expected to satisfy themselves before booking that they are fit and able to complete the
        itinerary of their chosen component as described by NTT. Clients are also expected to accept that the components
        described constitute “Adventure Travel” and that travel to and facilities in developing countries will not be
        too similar standards which they may be accustomed to at home.</br>

        Clients agree to accept the authority and decisions of NTT’s employees, tour leaders, and agents whilst on
        components with NTT. If in the opinion of such person the health or conduct of a client before or after
        departure appears likely to endanger the safe, comfortable, or happy progress of a component the client may be
        excluded from all or part of the component, at his or her own expense, and without any refund. In the case of
        ill health, NTT may make such arrangements as it sees fit and the associated total costs of these arrangements
        including expenses of NTT must be paid for by the client. If a client is excluded as above or chooses to leave
        of their own free will or leaves due to ill health or any other reason there will be no refund of the component
        price, extra services surcharges, local fund, or any local surcharges. All services forming part of the whole
        package booked will be forfeit though may be recoverable through your travel insurance in some circumstances.

        <h2>8.Local Laws</h2>
        All participants in components operated by NTT are expected to obey the laws and regulations of the countries
        visited and any failure to do so will relieve NTT of all obligations that they may otherwise have under these
        booking conditions.

        <h2>9. Illness or Disability</h2>
        Anyone suffering from illness or disability or undergoing treatment for any physical or medical condition must
        declare the true nature of such condition at the time of booking and make arrangements for the provision of any
        medication or other treatment which may be required during the component. Failure to make such disclosure will
        constitute a breach of these booking conditions and result in such persons being excluded from the component in
        which case all monies paid will be forfeit.

        <h2>10. If you have a Complaint</h2>
        If the client has a complaint about any of the component arrangements the client must bring it to the attention
        of the tour leader or other representative of NTT at the time so that they may use their best endeavors to
        rectify the situation. It is only if TAB is made aware of any problems that there will be the opportunity

        <h2>11. Changing terms of use</h2>
        NTT holds the right to change the terms of use at any moment without previous notice. Changes take effect at the
        moment of denunciation. Visitors are obligated to notice those changes and adapt to them.
